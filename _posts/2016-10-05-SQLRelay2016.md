title: "SQL Relay 2016"
---

Thanks to our illustrious leader at the [CaRdiff meetup][5c7eaeb7] I ended up moonlighting at [SQL Relay 2016][a2cdc1bc]. It was pretty interesting to see so much material for a language that I am only just starting to grasp. Luckily there were also a few people taking some liberty with the SQL focus. [Purple Frog Systems][f7faf8d3] had a great talk about setting up an IoT connected Raspberry Pi to log light and temperature, doing the whole process from scratch. From loading the [Windows Core OS][220a9fae] onto the device to setting up data warehousing in SQL Server 2016 and visualisation in PowerBI. Obviously a little SQL in there, but something I could get my head around none the less.

So not only was I interloping into the SQL community, but I also pushed some R onto them. I presented a _brief_ talk on using R to calculate a distance matrix to locate the closest weather station to a particular postcode in the UK. For those that missed it or want to see the code, both the repo and the reveal.js slides (written in Rmarkdown) [are available on Github][ef32b169].

Thanks to all the SQL Relay team, have fun in Reading and Nottingham, see you next year?
